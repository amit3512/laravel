                Currently there are more than 1700 (three thousand) education agents registered at the Ministry of Education, Nepal. But the reality is there are over 4,000 education agents operating in Nepal’s various cities.<br />
                <br /><strong> Hence, choosing the right education agent, channel partner and managing them effectively is essential.</strong>
